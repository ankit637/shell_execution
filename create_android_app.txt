first you have to install ubuntu desktop: https://ubuntu.com/desktop
some youtuber or institutes suggest did it on google colabs,kali linux but i really suggest do it on ubuntu, because it is required for "buildozer" that we will be used in this creation
Android on Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 (64bit)

First, install the buildozer project with:

pip3 install --user --upgrade buildozer

    
according to "buildozer" documentetion you need to install some requirements:
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y git zip unzip openjdk-17-jdk python3-pip autoconf libtool pkg-config zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libtinfo5 cmake libffi-dev libssl-dev
    pip3 install --user --upgrade Cython==0.29.33 virtualenv

If openjdk-17 is not compatible with other installed programs, for Buildozer the minimum compatible openjdk version is 11.

 installation is completed
now, you have to do some changes:
# add the following line at the end of your ~/.bashrc file
      terminal: cd ~/.bashrc file
      export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/  #add this line in end of your file  with gedit or nano and save it.

after done this process:
        1.create you working directory: mkdir app-development
        2. create a "main.py" file in that directory #you can  copy/paste your python file but name should be "main.py"
        3. sudo ~/.local/bin/buildozer init
        after this command executes output be like: succesfully "buildozer.spec" is created
        then you need to some changes in "buildozer.spec" with gedit or nano
        Edit the "buildozer.spec" according to the specifications. 
        You should at least change the title, package.name and package.domain in the [app] section
        don't forget to uncomment and edit this line:
        # Permissions
        android.permissions = INTERNET, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE #you can add other permissions as required for your app
        save the file.


        Locate the following line: for output will be generated that name

        output.filename = Brocodersg.apk
        
        3. start creating your app
        sudo ~/.local/bin/buildozer -v android debug
now, your app is started creating itself
        Note: it will be take some time about 30-50 minutes as depend on your internet speed
        after done this process, you can see the folder "bin" is created in your working directory
        cd bin #your app is here: Brocoders.apk

its time to test your app with directly "adb"
          1. turn on your phone 
          2. turn on developer options and  debugging
          3. plug your usb cable pc/laptop to phone
          4. execute command in "bin" directory of next line
          5. adb install -r YourApp.apk
          6. a small permission ask on your phone press "allow"
          now, app is intalled succesfully

          HAPPY CODING WITH PYTHON/KIVY
